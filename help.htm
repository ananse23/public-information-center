        <h1>Online Help:</h1>
	    <p>The <b>Public Information Center</b> application allows citizens to review activities published by the local government, submit requests for service in their community, and review social media feeds to see what is being said about their community. Initially, this application supports infrastructure agencies and uses operational layers typically published by water utilities or public infrastructure agencies.   But in the future, it will be configured to support a comprehensive local government citizen service application organized for other agencies and a wide range of issues.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The Public Information Center has three primary functions.  The first is to provide citizens access to authoritative information about work activities happening in their community.  These work activities include capital projects, main breaks, alerts, and out-of-service hydrants. You can turn on and off projects and assets in the left navigation pane.  When you find a project or asset you're interested in, select it from the list and it will be highlighted on the map.  If you click on an individual asset or project on the map, additional detail will be provided. <br></br> The second function allows citizens to submit requests for service. Search for an address or click directly on the map to locate your request for service. Then, provide details about the request below and click Submit to initiate your request. You'll be provided a Request # that can be used to track the status of your request.  If you find a request has already been submitted by someone else at the location you're interested in, you can select the existing service request and provide additional comments and rank the importance of this issue to you. In local governments that have deployed an automated system (CRM/ CMMS systems) to track service requests and work activities, the online requests will be routed to staff responsible for its resolution. If an automated is not present in the local government, a manual service ticket will typically be created and routed to appropriate staff.<br /><br />Finally, citizens can also use the application to discover what the community is saying about events and activities happening in the area by looking closer at social media feeds from Youtube, Twitter and Flickr.  You can turn on and off the social media feeds you're interestd in and then click on the feed location on the map to get additional information. Please note, this information is being provided directly from YouTube, Twitter and Flickr sources and is not filtered before being displayed in this application.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are two primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a project notice, service request, or social media feed when you've located it. You can also search for an address or service request by request number.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br/><br/>1. Use the basemap switcher to select the basemap you'd like to interact with<br/>2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br/>3. Hold Down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br/>4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br/>5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>The search box can be used to find an address or location you're interested in:<br/><br/>1. Use the radio dial to select the search method you'd like to use<br/>2. Enter the address or specific service request number you're interested in<br>3. Click on the item in the list to locate the address or service request on the map<br/><br/>You can enter a partial address and then identify the correct value in the list.</p>
        <h4><u>Project Notices and Alerts</u></h4>
        <p>The location of construction projects, public notices or alerts, out of service hydrants, and main breaks can be turned on and off in the left navigation pane.  When you find a project, notice, or asset you're interested in, select it from the list and it will then be highlighted on the map. When you click on an individual asset or project on the map, additional detail will be provided in an information popup.</p>
        <h4><u>Service Requests</u></h4>
        <p>Search for an address or click directly on the map to locate your request for service. Then, provide details about the request and click Submit to initiate your request. You'll be provided a Request # that can be used to track the status of your request. If you find a request has already been submitted by another party, you can click on the existing request, provide additional comments and increase the importance of the request.</p>
        <h4><u>Social Media Feeds</u></h4>
        <p>You can discover what is being said about events and activities happening in and around your local government by looking closer at social media feeds from YouTube, Twitter and Flickr. When you find a Tweet, YouTube video, or Flickr photo in the area you're interested in, you can click on it and additional detail will be provided in an information popup. <i>Please note: This information is being provided directly from YouTube, Twitter and Flickr sources and is not filtered before being displayed in this application.</i></p>
        <h4><u>Share Your Map</u></h4>
        <p>You can click on the Share Map button to share your map several different ways.  You can compose an email, post to your Facebook wall or post a Tweet. When you use the Facebook or Twitter links, you'll be asked to sign in to your respective account.</p>
        <h4><u>More Information</u></h4>
        <p>The <b>Public Information Center</b> can be used by water utilities, public works agencies, or other local government organizations to deliver a web-based public information application. This application provides 24x7 access to the organization and typically supplements customer service phone numbers staffed by local governments.<br /><br />Please visit Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government Resource Center for more information.</p>
        <h4><u>Browser Compatibility</u></h4>
        <p>The Public Information Center application is supported on the following browsers: Microsoft IE 7/8/9, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari.<br/></p>
